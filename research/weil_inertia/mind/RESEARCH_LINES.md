## Keep source regularity separate from regularity of the canonical defect measure

WI-417--WI-422 identify sharp coercive source-space phenomena for translated-Blaschke probes. With an independently fixed planar density cap, one-target cost has the expected shallow-depth blow-up and critically separated target families converge to a Poisson-capacity problem. Generic TV/Carleson control is too weak because target-adaptive atoms remain cheap. For the bare translated-Blaschke response, ordinary global `L^p` control is bounded exactly for `1<p<2`, with a Lorentz endpoint and different behavior once a finite-TV budget is added.

WI-423 shows why those useful auxiliary spaces cannot simply be imposed on the canonical exact zeta source. The Riesz identity `-Delta U = 2 pi mu_off` makes that source the atomic counting measure of off-critical zeros; exact absolute continuity of the same source would already force the defect measure to vanish. A nontrivial route must therefore generate an auxiliary probe/coefficient source independently and prove an exact or quantitatively controlled coupling from its potential back to the canonical defect measure.

The live question is to derive such an auxiliary source and a target-independent concentration-and-tail budget from accessible prime-side, boundary or explicit-formula data. The norm must be fixed without inspecting hypothetical zero locations and must control the actual Poisson-capacity geometry consumed by the destination.

## Approach the boundary with independently controlled information; compact mixed-frequency repairs are asymptotically blind

WI-424 identifies the boundary logarithmic derivative of the Kunik Blaschke factor as a canonical positive Poisson defect counter. WI-425--WI-428 show why fixed safe lines and bounded positive or signed multiscale portfolios lose shallow defects unless their cost becomes singular. WI-429 supplies a different bounded category: the positive Hardy projection on `Re(s)=1/2+a` keeps exactly the zeros deeper than `a` and, as `a downarrow0`, retains a fixed fraction of the boundary defect energy. WI-430 extracts the corresponding first-defect quantum, making clear that an unconditional subquantum upper bound would already contain the missing zero-exclusion theorem.

WI-431--WI-434 then audit horizontal continuation from the absolutely convergent prime side. The global positive Hardy projection is zero on `Re(s)>1`; adiabatic localization does not create persistent positive-frequency source leakage; the exact horizontal transport identity splits the interior field into safe-line leakage, a window-edge term and transported residues; and the apparent principal-pole divergence of that edge disappears after exact semigroup transport.

WI-435 gives the decisive matched control. Even if the entire transported edge and safe-line leakage are both `o(1)`, a finite Kunik Blaschke block leaves a nonzero interior Hardy residue field with the full first-defect quantum. Horizontal transport therefore represents the defect more faithfully as its auxiliary errors vanish; it does not upper-bound that defect from independent source information.

WI-436 closes the most canonical translation-invariant mixed-frequency continuation. For a finite Kunik block and any probe line `0<a<d_*`, the non-Hermitian square of the interior logarithmic derivative satisfies the exact line-invariant identity

`int G_(F,a)(t)^2 dt = ||h_F||_2^2`,

where `h_F` is the positive boundary Poisson flux. Splitting `G_(F,a)=G_++G_-` into Hardy half-spaces gives

`2 int G_+(t)G_-(t) dt = ||h_F||_2^2`.

Thus the simplest bilinear positive/negative-frequency coupling sees the off-line defect perfectly, but the finite-Blaschke matched control saturates it identically. The signal is coercive without being independent source control.

WI-437 sharpens the surviving non-translation-invariant/Hankel branch. For one right-half Kunik defect of horizontal depth `d` and a probe line at fixed relative depth `a=theta d`, the normalized Hardy channels become uniformly weakly null as `d downarrow0`. Every **fixed compact** cross-channel operator therefore has normalized matrix element tending to zero uniformly in the zero ordinate, while the canonical WI-436 pairing remains the fixed fraction `sqrt(1-theta^2)` of the channel norms and has size `pi m^2/d`. Compact corrections are asymptotically lower order on arbitrarily shallow defects.

For classical Hankel operators this gives a concrete category gate through Hartman's theorem: symbols in the compact `H^infinity+C` class, including fixed smooth compactly supported or decaying boundary multipliers after the half-plane identification, are blind at the required shallow-defect scale. A viable mixed-frequency route must contain an **essentially noncompact** component, or a parameter family whose compactness degenerates at the same scale. Noncompactness is only necessary: the essential response on the shallow Hardy packets must also remain order one and be fixed by independent arithmetic/source data.

The live theorem is therefore narrower than “find a non-translation-invariant coupling.” First determine the Calkin/essential class of any proposed source-derived cross-frequency operator. If it is compact, or remains norm-precompact in the shallow regime, WI-437 rules it out as a uniform first-defect detector. If it is noncompact, prove that its essential matrix elements on the exact boundary-kernel family are nonzero and source-controlled without importing the hypothetical divisor. A genuinely nonlinear arithmetic relation or another independently bounded boundary/source observable remains possible, but a fixed compact Hankel repair cannot supply the missing coercive quantum.

Every proposal must still pass the finite Kunik Blaschke adversarial test. WI-437 is a one-defect/fixed-relative-depth compactness barrier, not a theorem that every noncompact operator works and not a full-zeta localization theorem. A successful passage to zeta must additionally handle the absence of a fixed probe depth to the left of all possible off-line zeros and derive the proposed essential coupling from admissible source information rather than from the target zero configuration.
